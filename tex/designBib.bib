@book{Atkinson1992,
abstract = {A well-designed experiment is an efficient method for learning about the physical world, however since experiments in any setting cannot avoid random error, statistical methods are essential for their design and implementation, and for the analysis of results. In this book, the fundamentals of optimum experimental design theory are presented. In the first part, the advantages of a statistical approach to the design of experiments are discussed, and the ideas of models, least squares fitting, and optimum experimental designs are introduced. The second part presents a more detailed discussion of the general theory of optimum design and an evaluation of various criteria that may be appropriate for designing experiments. Specific experiments are detailed and algorithms for the construction of designs are given. Each chapter is a self-contained, illustrated with examples drawn from science and engineering. Little previous statistical knowledge is assumed, and the derivation of mathematical results has been avoided. This book should be of interest to everyone concerned with designing experiments that are practical, efficient, and accurate.},

@article{Ascher2006,
abstract = {This paper considers the problem of reconstructing a piecewise smooth model function from given, measured data. The data are compared to a field which is given as a possibly nonlinear function of the model. A regularization functional is added which incorporates the a priori knowledge that the model function is piecewise smooth and may contain jump discontinuities. Regularization operators related to total variation (TV) are therefore employed. Two popular methods are modified TV and Huber's function. Both contain a parameter which must be selected. The Huber variant provides a more natural approach for selecting its parameter, and we use this to propose a scheme for both methods. Our selected parameter depends both on the resolution and on the model average roughness; thus, it is determined adaptively. Its variation from one iteration to the next yields additional information about the progress of the regularization process. The modified TV operator has a smoother generating function; nonetheless we obta...},

abstract = {An unbiased stochastic estimator of tr(I-A), where A is the influence matrix associated with the calculation of Laplacian smoothing splines, is described. The estimator is similar to one recently developed by Girard but satisfies a minimum variance criterion and does not require the simulation of a standard normal variable. It uses instead simulations of the discrete random variable which takes the values 1, -1 each with probability 1/2. Bounds on the variance of the estimator, similar to those established by Girard, are obtained using elementary methods. The estimator can be used to approximately minimize generalised cross validation (GCV) when using discretized iterative methods for fitting Laplacian smoothing splines to very large data sets. Simulated examples show that the estimated trace values, using either the estimator presented here or the estimator of Girard, perform almost as well as the exact values when applied to the minimization of GCV for n as small as a few hundred, where n is the number ...},

Based upon Richardson-type estimates of the truncation error, refined grids are created or existing ones removed to attain a given accuracy for a minimum amount of work. The approach is recursive in that fine grids can contain even finer grids. The grids with finer mesh width in space also have a smaller mesh width in time, making this a mesh refinement algorithm in time and space. We present the algorithm, error estimation procedure, and the data structures, and conclude with numerical examples in one and two space dimensions.},

abstract = {Typical optimal design methods for inverse or parameter estimation problems are designed to choose optimal sampling distributions through minimization of a specific cost function related to the resulting error in parameter estimates. It is hoped that the inverse problem will produce parameter estimates with increased accuracy using data collected according to the optimal sampling distribution. Here we formulate the classical optimal design problem in the context of general optimization problems over distributions of sampling times. We present a new Prohorov metric based theoretical framework that permits one to treat succinctly and rigorously any optimal design criteria based on the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM). A fundamental approximation theory is also included in this framework. A new optimal design, SE-optimal design (standard error optimal design), is then introduced in the context of this framework. We compare this new design criteria with the more traditional D-optimal and E-optimal designs. The optimal sampling distributions from each design are used to compute and compare standard errors; the standard errors for parameters are computed using asymptotic theory or bootstrapping and the optimal mesh. We use three examples to illustrate ideas: the Verhulst-Pearl logistic population model [13], the standard harmonic oscillator model [13] and a popular glucose regulation model [16, 19, 29].},
